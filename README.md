# dwikamekatama

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@dwikamekatama/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: web on Cloudflare
- Configure provider login: `cd packages/infra && npx alchemy login --configure`
- Dev: npm run dev
- Deploy: npm run deploy
- Destroy: npm run destroy

`alchemy login --configure` stores the selected Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && npx alchemy deploy --stage production
```
